        <p>I have decided to write a blog so I can forever remember and look back on these insane, unprecedented times. We have been social distancing for about 2 weeks now, which means that schools are shut down and we are encouraged to stay home. This week, the U.S. topped China in total deaths due to COVID-19, and they have put areas that have cases under shelter in place, which means that it is illegal to leave your house for any reason other than to get neccesities. Spring break was right before social distancing started, which means that we have been stuck at home for 3 weeks with nothing to do, and with no end in sight. This week our teachers started sharing assignments on Google Classroom so that we could continue our education at home, but it's not too bad. Even with all the craziness going on, my weekday's are pretty structured. I wake up around 9:30, check all my notifications, eat breakfast, and then me, Mom, Bryn, and Ally walk the dogs up and down the driveway while listening to our daily devotional. After that I usually do my school work on the computer - which takes about an hour - and then we head to the elementary school where they hand out free lunches Monday through Thursday. I normally spend my afternoons by learning computer progamming (which is how I learned to do this), riding my bike, reading, shooting baskets on my nerf basketball goal, playing Xbox, playing mancala with the girls, etc. We have started going up to the courts to hit, and after we are done, Mom lets us drive around the parking lot. At night we normally watch TV as a family, and then me and Mom watch about 4 episodes of The Office when everyone else goes to bed, although she falls asleep midway through the first episode. I then wake up, and repeat it all over again. I'm not bored that often, but occasionally I am. I enjoy living like this, but it can get repetitive sometimes. Wow, I think this is enough for the first day. I look forward to writing tomorrow.<br>
